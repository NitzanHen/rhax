Rhax is a Typescript-first library for simple and elegant data transformations.<br/>
It was created with the "casual" Typescript functional programmer in mind, and aims to provide the advantages of functional programming, without requiring the programmer to surrender the entire codebase to the paradigm's constraints, restrictive methods, and ocean of jargon.

It is lightweight, easy to pick up, and simple to introduce to new as well as existing projects.

## Installation
```bash
npm install rhax
# or
yarn add rhax
```

## The idea
Functional programming is a progamming paradigm
